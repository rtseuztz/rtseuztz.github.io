## Project Overview

For my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class, I led a comprehensive UX redesign project focused on improving the two-factor authentication experience. Using the needfinding process, I conducted research with real survey participants to understand pain points and user expectations.

## Process

- **Needfinding Research**: Conducted surveys with actual users to identify friction points in current 2FA implementations
- **User Insights**: Analyzed feedback to understand security concerns, usability challenges, and accessibility needs
- **Iterative Design**: Developed multiple design iterations based on user feedback
- **Prototyping**: Created an interactive prototype demonstrating the improved authentication flow

## Outcome

The final prototype showcases a more intuitive and user-friendly two-factor authentication experience that maintains security while reducing friction. The design prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and user confidence throughout the authentication process.

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design and how research-driven insights can significantly improve security-critical interfaces. By involving real users in the design process, we created solutions that are both secure and genuinely usable.
